My main requirement is to be able to put all of this information into the system for easy monitoring:

•	Employee Information
•	Disciplinary Records
•	Issue memos from within the system
•	Disciplinary History
•	Access to Company Handbook for reference
•	Attendance Records
•	Emergency/Vacation Leaves monitoring
•	Attendance History
•	Training/Seminars Records
•	Performance Evaluation Records

I would also like to update the employee info to include facebook profile and other social media information. Can we design the interface of the system so as to look like a facebook page?
